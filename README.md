# My Portfolio Website
I've developed a portfolio website using React JS and Vite. I have used Leetcode's APIs to display the total number of questions I’ve solved in each difficulty out of the total questions of Leetcode.
Similarly, I have fetched chess.com’s user APIs to display my current ratings in rapid, blitz, bullet, and daily time formats.

I've also used modern day image formats such as WebP which offers superior lossless and lossy compression, resulting in smaller image files and faster website loading times compared to traditional formats like JPEG and PNG. 

The website is fully responsive, ensuring optimal viewing on all devices.

Daily website traffic is monitored using Vercel Analytics. Real Experience Score (RES) for the users is monitored using Vercel's Speed Insights which measures various performance metrics like speed, responsiveness, and stability. These metrics are directly related to SEO.
