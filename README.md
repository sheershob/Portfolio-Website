# My Portfolio Website
I've developed a portfolio website using React JS and Vite. I have used Leetcode's graphql APIs to display the total number of questions I’ve solved in each difficulty out of the total questions of Leetcode.
Similarly, I have fetched chess.com’s user APIs to display my current ratings in rapid, blitz, bullet, and daily time formats.
